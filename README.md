# Code Smell Detection with Machine Learning - Colab Experiment

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that experiments with various machine learning techniques for detecting code smells. The primary focus is on reproducing and extending the findings from the paper **"Comparing and Experimenting Machine Learning Techniques for Code Smell Detection"**.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: The notebook uses one or more datasets to train and test machine learning models for code smell detection.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Different algorithms are explored to determine their effectiveness in identifying code anomalies, and their results are analyzed for biases or limitations.
  
- **Bias and Limitation Analysis**: Special attention is given to understanding the biases in the original research and how they might affect the results. The goal is to produce insights and detect limitations in the machine learning outcomes.

Feel free to explore the notebook and modify the parameters to experiment with your own datasets or models.
